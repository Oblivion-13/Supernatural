                    <p class="paragraph">
                        The Winchester Family are Men of Letters and hunters.
                        The Winchester bloodline goes back to their ancestors
                        Cain and Abel. Mary Winchester comes from a family of
                        hunters, while the Winchester line was traditionally Men
                        of Letters. Sam and Dean Winchester were destined to be
                        the vessels of Archangel Michael and Lucifer.

                    <p class="paragraph">
                        He is the oldest son of John and Mary, the older brother
                        of Sam, and the older paternal half-brother of Adam. He
                        is one of the members of the Winchester family. He was
                        raised into hunting by his father, John. From birth, he
                        was destined to be the vessel of the Archangel Michael

                        He is the youngest son of John and Mary. He is the
                        younger brother of Dean and the older paternal
                        half-brother of Adam. He is one of the three surviving
                        members of the Winchester family. His father, John,
                        hadn't brought him into hunting right away like his
                        older brother, Dean. Instead, he had to find out who his
                        family was the hard way and eventually was forced to go
                        into "The Family Business". From birth, he was destined
                        to be the vessel of the Archangel Lucifer

                    Hunters, also known as ハンター (Hanta) in Japan, and Breakers
                    in Scotland, are people, usually humans, who hunt down the
                    supernatural and save people from monsters, demons, ghosts
                    and other creatures and supernatural events.

                    They usually are just typical humans who, unlike others, are
                    aware of the existence of supernatural beings and, even
                    more, they fight against them to protect normal people from
                    harm. One of the most recurring reasons to go into the
                    hunter lifestyle is a tragedy in their lives that involved
                    the supernatural (Mary Winchester, John's wife and Dean and
                    Sam's mother, being killed by the demon Azazel; Bobby
                    Singer's wife being possessed by a demon and Bobby having to
                    kill her). However, there are other reasons to decide being
                    a supernatural hunter, such as being raised as one.
                    It is also shown that supernatural hunters typically pass
                    their knowledge onto their children, as they could be killed
                    by supernatural creatures that look for revenge or could
                    appear. When they do so, a family of supernatural hunters is
                    formed, like the Campbells, Harvelles or the Winchesters.
                    Most hunters have a good physical condition suitable for
                    hunting, and possess an extensive knowledge of the
                    supernatural and mythology as well.
